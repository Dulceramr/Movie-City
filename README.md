# Movie City

### Overview 
Welcome to Movie City, a React and TypeScript-powered Single Page App that utilizes The Movie Database API V3 to bring you information about movies, including titles, release dates, posters, and descriptions. The project is deployed with Netlify.

From the main view, you can see a carousel featuring trending movies. You can also perform a search by filtering by genre, popularity, title, and rating or directly writing on the input cage.

The list of movies is displayed with a badge indicating the vote average. This badge is shown in red if the value is less than 6; if it's greater than this number, it is displayed in blue.

At both the top and bottom of the page, there is a pagination element that allows access to different pages, either previous or next.
